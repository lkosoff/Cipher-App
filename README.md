# DCrypto (Work in Progress)
Desktop app built from Python and PyQt6
# Overview
This side project originally started as three seperate projects: A commandline image steganography encoder/decoder, a enciphering tool, and a monoalphabetic substitution solver.  I decided to merge all three projects into a desktop app using PyQt for the GUI

# Ciphers
The project contains implenetation of several classic ciphers such as Atbash, Vigenere, Railfence, etc.

# Monoalphabetic Substitution Solver

This was a tool that automatically solves monoalphabetic substitution ciphers by minimizing a loss function

# Steganography

This is a tool that allows the user to upload an image and encode a message into the pixel values of the image.
